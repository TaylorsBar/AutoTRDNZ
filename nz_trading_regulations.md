# New Zealand Trading Requirements and Regulations

## Overview
This document outlines the key regulatory requirements and compliance considerations for developing an autonomous trading application in New Zealand. The Financial Markets Authority (FMA) is New Zealand's primary financial market regulator responsible for overseeing financial products and services.

## Regulatory Framework

### Financial Markets Authority (FMA)
- The FMA is New Zealand's national financial market regulator responsible for overseeing multiple products and services
- Established in 2011 following the 2008 financial crisis to replace the Securities Commission
- The FMA has powers to monitor compliance, investigate, and take enforcement action against conduct that contravenes legislation

### Key Legislation
- Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMC Act) - The primary legislation governing financial markets in New Zealand
- Financial Markets Authority Act 2011 - Established the FMA as a Crown Entity
- Financial Services Legislation Amendment Act 2019 (FSLAA) - Updated laws governing financial advice

## Licensing Requirements

### Derivatives Issuer License
For an autonomous trading application that deals with derivatives (including forex, CFDs, etc.), a derivatives issuer license from the FMA is required if making regulated offers to retail investors.

Key requirements for derivatives issuers:
1. Must be licensed by the FMA to make regulated offers of derivatives
2. Subject to strict licensing requirements due to the high-risk nature of derivatives products
3. Currently only 22 active derivatives issuer licenses in New Zealand
4. Recent updates to standard conditions include new requirements for business continuity and technology systems

### Discretionary Investment Management Service (DIMS)
If the autonomous trading application makes investment decisions on behalf of users:
1. A DIMS license may be required
2. A DIMS provider can make trading and investment decisions without first consulting the investor
3. Subject to specific regulatory requirements and oversight

## Compliance Considerations

### Client Money Handling
- Client funds must be held in segregated accounts
- Strict requirements for handling and protecting client money

### Risk Disclosure
- Clear disclosure of risks associated with trading derivatives
- Transparent information about the autonomous nature of the trading system

### Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Requirements
- Compliance with AML and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) regulations
- Customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring requirements

### Leverage Restrictions
- The FMA has proposed leverage restrictions of up to 30:1 for CFDs
- This would align with restrictions in other jurisdictions like Australia, Europe, and the UK

### Algorithmic Trading Considerations
- Automated trading systems must include appropriate risk controls
- Systems must be tested and monitored to prevent market disruption
- The FMA and NZX have increased focus on algorithmic trading oversight

## Technology and Business Continuity Requirements
- Updated standard conditions for derivatives issuers include specific requirements for technology systems
- Business continuity planning is mandatory
- Systems must be robust, secure, and reliable

## Dispute Resolution
- Financial service providers must belong to an approved Dispute Resolution Scheme (DRS)
- Four approved DRS operating in New Zealand to help consumers resolve disputes

## Registration Requirements
- All financial services providers must be registered on the Financial Services Provider Register (FSPR)
- FSPR registration is separate from licensing and does not grant permission to operate

## Conclusion
Developing an autonomous trading application for New Zealand users requires careful consideration of the regulatory framework. The application will likely need a derivatives issuer license from the FMA, especially if it offers leveraged trading products to retail investors. The licensing process involves demonstrating compliance with strict requirements around client money handling, risk disclosure, technology systems, and business continuity planning.

The recent focus on algorithmic trading by regulators suggests that autonomous trading systems will face increased scrutiny, particularly regarding risk controls and system stability. As regulations continue to evolve, staying current with FMA guidance and requirements will be essential for maintaining compliance.
